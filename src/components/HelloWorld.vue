        </div>
        <div class="basis-1/2">
          HTTP API Problems RFC 7807 is a document that provides a standardized
          way for HTTP APIs to communicate errors or problems to clients. This
          document defines a format for problem details, or error messages, to
          be returned to clients in a consistent and machine-readable way.

          When should you use API Problems?
        </div>
        <div class="basis-1/2">
          Having different API errors for different APIs can make it difficult
          for clients to understand how to handle errors and can lead to
          inconsistent error handling across different APIs. Standardizing error
          messages with RFC 7807 can provide consistency and confidence.

          When you're building your API you could build documentation pages
          which explain exactly what every single type of error is, then include
          a link to that page in the JSON error response. You could literally
          have "Ran out of snacks at the office" as an error type. If you don't
          have time for all that, you can use these basic error types based on
          HTTP status codes.
